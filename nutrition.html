										  <p>Pre and post workout nutrition is simple: one is fuel and the other one is repair. You eat before your workout to have the extra energy to push yourself during a training session. You eat afterwards to repair the damage done to your muscles, help them rebuild faster and grow. Depending on your goals, you can do either or both, or you can ignore it altogether.</p>
										  <p><strong><center>Pre and Post Workout for Weight Loss</center></strong></p>
										  <p>To lose weight you can either train on an empty stomach or train with a light snack that you will burn shortly after you start your workout. You need a pre workout snack if you are so hungry you are feeling weak otherwise you will not be able to push yourself hard enough - not enough to force your body to change and/or burn more reserves. Your goal is to train to raise your heart rate and body temperature sufficiently to speed up your metabolism. So the harder you work during your training session, the more you burn throughout the day after your workout. If you were too weak to work out at 100% it does not mean your workout was wasted: it is just was not as effective for the long term burn.</p>
										  <p>A post-workout snack consumed roughly 30 minutes after your workout can help you repair the damage done to your cells and help you recover faster. It is usually a small protein snack or shake.</p>
										  <p><strong><center>Pre and Post Workout for Muscle Building</center></strong></p>
										  <p>To gain weight, on the other hand, pre and post workout nutrition is a must. You can not let your body struggle for resources at any point because it will burn everything and make it difficult for you to then build muscle after exercising (which is when all muscle building is really done).</p>
										  <p><strong><center>The Timing</center></strong></p>
										  <p>You should never work out on full stomach, you will simply throw up or you will feel uncomfortable at the very least and will not be able to give it your all. As a rule, your main meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) should happen at least 2 hours before your workout to give your body a chance to digest the food.</p>
										  <p>Pre workout snacks are normally tiny amounts of food that can be processed quickly and then aid your performance and recovery. You should consume pre workout snack roughly 30-60 minutes before a workout. Post workout snacks are also small and are most effective within 30 minutes after your training session.</p>
										  <p>Neither pre nor post workout snacks are mandatory if you are trying to lose weight. You only need to concern yourself with those if you are trying to build muscle and you do not want to accidentally lose some.</p>
										  <p>A pre-workout snack is only useful in this case if it has been several hours since your last meal, you are about to faint from hunger but you are still have a training session ahead of you which you need to get through. Then yes, sure, have a banana.</p>

										<div class="panel-body">
										  <p>When it comes to nutrition for muscle building and weight gain there are only three rules to remember: eat more, eat often, eat quality food.</p>
										  <p><strong><center>Quality + Quantity</center></strong></p>
										  <p>There is no other way around it. In order to gain weight you need to eat more, a lot more, but you need to eat quality muscle building food rather than junk food like doughnuts and chips. Because you are aiming to build muscle rather than just get fat, eating a lot of the wrong things will not give you the results you want.</p>
										  <p>To gain weight and gain quality muscle mass you need to base your diet around an intake of quality protein and complex carbohydrates. Make sure you eat more poultry (chicken and turkey), fish and lean meat (pork and beef), eggs and low fat dairy (Greek yogurts and low fat cheese are the best), beans, quinoa, oatmeal, nuts, nut butters and oils. If you are vegetarian or vegan, check out tempeh and seitan meat substitutes. Milk, cow or any other type, is also a good source of protein. Vegans need to incorporate foods that contain the amino acids that are key to the bodys synthesizing of muscle-building protein.</p>
										  <p>The tricky bit and the main reason most people struggle to gain weight is the lack of preparation and / or finances. It takes time and money to make six quality meals with meat, healthy fats and fiber on a regular basis and keep on doing it every single day. And that is exactly what professional bodybuilders do: they pre-make their meals and time each one religiously and, on top of everything else, they also drink protein shakes.</p>
										  <p><strong><center>Protein Powders</center></strong></p>
										  <p>Protein powders are not magic and they are not a fix-it-all solution, they are more of a convenience and are definitely not an absolute must.</p>
										  <p>Why do some people use them:</p>
										  <p>a) It is easier to make a shake on the go than sit down for yet another meal before and after your training session.<br> b) One shake will give you the alternative of eating two chicken breasts protein-wise and it is a lot cheaper than buying chicken breasts, too, so you can see why it is a popular choice.<br> c) Most powders are also metabolised faster so they do give you faster visible results.</p>
              									  <p>Protein powders are basically a bodybuilding shortcut. They are concentrated protein in powdered form from food you would have to eat otherwise like milk (whey and casein protein), rice, soy, pea and hemp. Powders like that do not provide you with the nutrients whole-foods do but they can be a convenient way to get the extra protein you need for muscle building and weight gain.</p>
										  <p><strong><center>The Timing</center></strong></p>
										  <p>Most of the time it does not matter precisely when you have your meals, as long as you have regular intervals to eat in. If you also work out, though, and if your workouts are especially demanding then it is crucial that you have pre and post workout meals. For muscle building you should never train on empty, early in the morning before breakfast or 4-5 hours since your last meal and you should also eat within 30 minutes after your training sessions. If you do not have anything before or right after training your body will soon start burning muscle mass and that is exactly what you want to avoid if your goal is to gain muscle weight.</p>
										  <p>You want to give your body enough fuel to have a productive session (have a pre-workout snack) and you want to have a recovery meal as soon as possible (post workout meal or snack) to aid muscle growth and replenish your glycogen stores so your body does not burn any gains you made. It should also be a quality protein + complex carbohydrates snack not a bag of chips. Have a peanut butter toast or sardine bruschetta, Greek yogurt with banana and nuts or two hardboiled eggs.</p>
										  <p>None of it is rocket science. All of it is common sense and planning, but it does require discipline. The results however will speak for themselves.</p>

										 <p><strong>Roast meat and vegetables in the oven instead of frying.</strong> You can roast pretty much anything in the oven in half an hour or less with only one teaspoon of olive oil, salt and pepper.</p>
										 <p><strong>Try to have at least one meatless day a week</strong>. Use beans, tomato salads and salads with nut toppings, oven roasted broccoli and cauliflower, spinach and mushrooms with or without eggs to compensate.</p>
										 <p><strong>Snack on fruit, vegetables and low fat plain yogurts</strong> instead of chips and chocolate bars. If you do not like plain yogurts, make your own toppings using fruit, berries, seeds, nuts, honey or cinnamon.</p>
										 <p><strong>Try to eat meals that are at least half vegetables</strong>. Vegetables can be eaten in pretty much unlimited amounts and can easily fill up a plate making a meal look larger.</p>
										 <p><strong>Use fresh sliced tomato or mashed avocado instead of ketchup and mayo</strong> in sandwiches. Most chicken or turkey sandwiches and wraps taste delicious without any sauces at all when topped with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.</p>
										 <p><strong>Go whole grains when possible</strong>. White flour based products taste better but they are stripped from most of vitamins and fiber making them of low value to your body. Also due to higher fiber contents whole grains take a lot longer to digest keeping you fuller longer. Eat oatmeal, quinoa, brown and wild rice, rye and wholegrain bread when you can.</p>
										 <p><strong>Eat one piece of fruit with every breakfast</strong>. Turn it into a <em><b>Fruit of the day</b></em> challenge. It does not have to be a different type of fruit every time, as long as you have a piece. If you do not have time to crunch on anything, make a smoothie or slice it up, it is all about making it convenient.</p>
										 <p><strong>Try to only eat home cooked meals</strong>, avoid anything pre-made and ready. No one will care about your food (and what is in it) more than you do.</p>

										  <p>If you're a vegetarian you need to provide your body with foods that contain the essential amino acids that are used as building blocks of protein in the body. Every time you eat food of any kind your body breaks it down into three basic groups: A) Useful stuff &nbsp;B) Energy C) Waste.</p>
										  <p>Useful stuff are foods which contain vitamins and the amino acids the body needs in order to create more complex molecules which then form what everyone sees: like hair, skin, eyes, muscle and so on. Energy comes from foods which contain either sugar or fat and depending on your bodys energy needs some of it will be used up immediately while the rest will be stored for later. Waste is everything your body cannot use or process and everyone knows what happens to waste.</p>
										  <p>Vegetarians and Vegans who train can still source everything they need for the body to build good quality muscle by eating a variety of foods which can be used to source the amino acids necessary to build protein in the body.</p>
										  <p>The table below provides some of the foods you can use to help your body build protein when you are on a meat-free diet.</p>
